2. Front-back abutment. (win7, Qinghui, Jiawei)
3. Back-end work based on front-end requirement. (LY)

### Specific Illustration

> The basic front-back code is writen as you can see, but it's just a test by LY, don't code on account of that code, of course you can consider it as a reference.

1. Each jade directing only one css and js, and the name of file is the same, e.g. about.jade -> bin/css/about,css, bin/js/about.js.
2. Every source code should be writen in src, e,g. about,jade -> src/coffee/about.coffee, src/sass/about.sass.
3. All you should write is jade, coffee, sass, and I have writen a Gruntfile for you to code more fluently.

### How To Run

> Developing environment building in /server path, and on this environment, you should visit localhost:3000, all your change on file(coffee, sass) would compile to js and css, and the browser would reload automatically.

1. # sudo npm install (for the first time you run this environment)
2. # npm start
3. # grunt
